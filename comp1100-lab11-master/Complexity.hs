module Complexity where

import Prelude hiding (elem, length, head, last, (++), nub)
-- Note that we will be defining many functions that already
-- exist in the Prelude. This flag prevents Haskell from
-- importing them from the Prelude, so we don't need to worry about
-- names clashing, and we can use the same names that the Prelude
-- uses.


{-
Exercise 1

Describe the complexity class of these functions in the best,
worse and average cases.
The first has already been done for you.

Exercise 2

Work out the complexity for these functions: fib1, fib2, power.

{-
Exercise 3

The power function can be optimised to be faster. 
Use the fact that x^(2n) = (x^n)^2 and x^(2n+1) = (x^n)^2 * x
to write a faster version.

Do not use (**) or (^) to solve this problem.
